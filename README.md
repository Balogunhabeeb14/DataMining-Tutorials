# DataMining-Tutorials 
This repository contains implementations of various data mining techniques, including machine learning models, association and clustering models, as well as neural networks and recurrent neural networks for time series analysis. The repository is organized into different folders to help you navigate through the code, data, and accompanying notes.

Folders
1. Data Folder
The data folder contains datasets used for training and testing the implemented models. Each dataset is stored in a separate file and is in a format suitable for the specific model's requirements.

2. Notes Folder
The notes folder contains explanatory documents and guides related to the models and techniques implemented in this repository. These notes provide insights, explanations, and usage instructions for each model, making it easier for you to understand and utilize the code.

3. Python Implementation Folder
The python_implementation folder contains the actual Python code implementing various data mining techniques. The code in a ipynb format can be run on google colab or jupyter notebook.Areas mostly covered include ML model implementation using Scikit-learn, which includes Python scripts implementing machine learning models such as decision trees, k-nearest neighbors (KNN), logistic regression, and other popular algorithms. Each script is well-documented and can be run independently.

Furthermore, the Python scripts implementing association mining models such as Apriori are contained in the implementation folder. These models are used to discover frequent itemsets and association rules in transactional datasets. Also, it contains Python scripts implementing clustering models such as k-means, DBSCAN, and hierarchical clustering. These models group similar data points together based on their characteristics or similarity measures.

Lastly, it contains Python scripts implementing neural network models, including feed-forward neural networks, convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and recurrent neural networks (RNNs). These models are useful for sequence analysis.
